# Advanced Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Analysis

## Overview
This scholarly Python project scrutinizes the efficacy of dimensionality reduction techniques—PCA, TSNE, UMAP—combined with K-means clustering on 'Pubmed' and 'Web Content' datasets. The initiative evaluates these methodologies' capacity to maintain the intrinsic data structure post-reduction, offering critical insights into their applicability in complex data analysis scenarios.

## Datasets
- **PubMed 20k RCT**: Clinical research article abstracts categorized into stages of clinical study.
- **Web Content**: Varied web text data spanning 16 categories, from education to e-commerce.

## Objectives
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Application and critical analysis of PCA, TSNE, and UMAP for insightful data compression.
- **Clustering Quality**: Integration with K-means clustering to assess alterations in data cluster fidelity.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Examination of parameter impacts on method performance, emphasizing perplexity (TSNE) and neighbor count (UMAP).

## Key Findings
- **Method Efficacy**: Diverse strengths observed across PCA (linear relationships), TSNE, and UMAP (complex local structures).
- **Optimal Parameterization**: Demonstrates the significance of hyperparameter fine-tuning in enhancing lower-dimensional data representations.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Silhouette scores and agreement coefficients facilitated a comparative analysis, showcasing UMAP's superior balance in structure preservation.
